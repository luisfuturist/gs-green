# TODO

## Artificial Intelligence Challenges (AIC) - 1/3
- [x] Read and understand the article on energy consumption optimization (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666546822000544).
- [x] Propose a solution using AI, IoT, Big Data, and other technologies based on insights from the article.
- [ ] Create a PDF document with the following sections:
  - [x] Add names of team members and a team logo (optional) on the first page.
  - [ ] Introduction: Contextualize the theme, objectives, challenges, barriers.
  - [ ] Development: Justify the use of technologies, explain how and why each technology is adopted, and include a diagram if necessary.
  - [ ] Results Expected: Estimate energy savings (e.g., for a household appliance), impact on comfort, equipment use, and lifespan.
  - [ ] Conclusion: Summarize development and expected results.
- [x] Optionally add additional titles or subsections to the document.

## Cognitive Data Science (CDS) - 1/3
- [x] Collect energy consumption data from government sources.
- [x] Store the data in a relational database.
