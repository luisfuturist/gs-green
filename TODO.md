- [ ] Propose a solution using AI, IoT, Big Data, and other technologies based on insights from the article.
- [ ] Create a PDF document with the following sections:
  - Introduction: Contextualize the theme, objectives, challenges, barriers.
  - Development: Justify the use of technologies, explain how and why each technology is adopted, and include a diagram if necessary.
  - Results Expected: Estimate energy savings (e.g., for a household appliance), impact on comfort, equipment use, and lifespan.
  - Conclusion: Summarize development and expected results.
- [ ] Optionally add additional titles or subsections to the document.

## 2. Artificial Intelligence with Computer Systems and Sensors (AICSS) - 20%
- [ ] Develop a circuit using ESP32 to optimize indoor and outdoor lighting.
- [ ] Use sensors (e.g., LDR for light detection, Ultrasonic for motion detection, LED for lighting simulation).
- [ ] Ensure outdoor lights are not fully off during the night for security purposes (related to cameras).
- [ ] Simulate the solution using Wokwi.
- [ ] Create a YouTube video (unlisted) demonstrating the circuit's functionality.
- [ ] Write a PDF document with the following:
  - Introduction: Describe the solution.
  - Code: Include source code.
  - YouTube Link: Provide the link to the video.
  - Conclusion: Discuss positive and negative impacts of the solution.

## 3. Statistical Computing with R (SCR) - 20%
- [ ] Access the open data from ANEEL (https://dadosabertos.aneel.gov.br/organization/).
- [ ] Choose a relevant dataset for energy consumption.
- [ ] Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify energy consumption patterns.
- [ ] Use descriptive statistics (frequency tables, graphs) and calculate central tendency measures (mean, median, mode), dispersion (variance, standard deviation), and percentiles.
- [ ] Provide insights for transitioning to sustainable energy sources based on the data analysis.

## 4. Cognitive Data Science (CDS) - 20%
- [ ] Collect energy consumption data from government sources.
- [ ] Store the data in a relational database.
- [ ] Create database objects to analyze trends in energy consumption.
- [ ] Develop a pipeline to filter and analyze energy demand data for Brazil, focusing on per capita consumption and other relevant metrics.

## 5. Computational Thinking with Python (CTWP) - 20%
- [ ] Develop a Python-based automated system to manage and optimize energy consumption in residences.
- [ ] Build a user interface to visualize energy data and efficiency reports.
- [ ] Ensure the system monitors real-time energy tariffs and consumption.
- [ ] Automate the selection of the most economical and sustainable energy source.

## 6. "Ir Al√©m" (Go Beyond) - 10%
- [ ] Integrate the Python system with the CDS database.
- [ ] Incorporate data from the AICSS solution into the Python system (manually transfer data from Wokwi simulation if needed).
- [ ] Trigger energy consumption analyses in R and integrate them into the Python system.
- [ ] Create a YouTube video (unlisted) explaining how the solutions from each discipline work together.
- [ ] Include the link to the video in the final PDF deliverable.

## 7. Final Deliverable
- [ ] Compile all sections into a single PDF document:
